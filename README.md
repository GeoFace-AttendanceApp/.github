# GeoFace - Attendance App

## What is GeoFace?
The Geoface Android application is an attendance app based on facial recognition and location. This application uses the device's location access to verify the user's location and utilizes the device's camera to capture a selfie of the user for recognition or classification. By leveraging a machine learning model hosted on a cloud service, the captured selfie is sent to the cloud to be recognized by the machine learning model.
